# 📊 Enhancing Credit Scoring with Non-Traditional Data using Machine Learning

This project aims to improve the accuracy and inclusivity of credit score predictions by incorporating alternative data sources—such as social media activity, utility payment records, and mobile phone usage—into a custom machine learning pipeline.

## 🧠 Overview

Traditional credit scoring models often exclude individuals without extensive financial histories, leading to a lack of access to credit for underbanked populations. This project addresses that gap by:

- Designing a machine learning pipeline that ingests, processes, and analyzes non-traditional data.
- Implementing advanced feature selection methods to optimize model performance.
- Ensuring ethical AI practices and data privacy compliance.

## ✅ Objectives

- Increase prediction accuracy using enriched feature sets.
- Promote financial inclusion by leveraging alternative data.
- Maintain ethical AI practices and data governance.

## 🧩 Features

- 📥 Integration of non-traditional data: social media score, utility payment history, mobile phone payment patterns.
- 🧪 Feature Selection Techniques: PCA, ANOVA, RFE.
- 🤖 ML Models Used: XGBoost, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Linear Regression.
- 📈 Achieved a **20% performance boost** after feature selection.
- 🔐 Ethical AI and Privacy Compliance.

## 📂 Dataset

- Combined 2–3 datasets related to:
  - **Utility payments** (on-time or delayed)
  - **Mobile phone usage** (timely payment status)
  - **Social media** (activity-derived credibility score)

All datasets were cleaned, merged, and engineered to produce the final dataset used for training and evaluation.

> *Note: All data used were anonymized or simulated to respect user privacy and adhere to data governance policies.*

## ⚙️ Workflow

1. **Data Collection & Cleaning**  
2. **Feature Engineering & Selection**  
3. **Model Training & Evaluation**  
4. **Performance Tuning**  
5. **Validation & Ethical Review**

## 📊 Results

- 📈 Improved model accuracy by **20%** post-feature selection.
- ⚖️ Increased credit access for underbanked individuals.
- ✅ Maintained fairness and transparency in scoring.

## 🧪 Tech Stack
